          <title>The Five Mathematical Proficiencies</title>
          
          <p>
            Success in mathematics depends on a rich combination of understanding, technique, 
            reasoning, and attitude. Research identifies <alert>five interrelated proficiencies</alert>:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <alert>Conceptual understanding</alert> <mdash/> comprehension of mathematical 
                concepts, operations, and relationships;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <alert>Procedural fluency</alert> <mdash/> skill in carrying out procedures 
                flexibly, accurately, efficiently, and appropriately;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <alert>Strategic competence</alert> <mdash/> ability to formulate, represent, 
                and solve mathematical problems;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <alert>Adaptive reasoning</alert> <mdash/> capacity for logical thought, 
                reflection, explanation, and justification;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <alert>Productive disposition</alert> <mdash/> habitual inclination to see 
                mathematics as sensible, useful, and worthwhile, coupled with belief in 
                diligence and one's own efficacy.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            These proficiencies do not develop from reading alone. But the big ideas of 
            mathematics can <em>only</em> be appreciated through careful study of dense 
            theoretical exposition.

          <title>The Exam Structure and Your Preparation</title>
          
          <p>
            The Leaving Certificate Mathematics paper has two sections, each worth 50%:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <alert>Section A: Concepts and Skills</alert> <mdash/> testing understanding 
                of core ideas and execution of standard procedures.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <alert>Section B: Contexts and Applications</alert> <mdash/> testing 
                problem-solving, mathematical reasoning, and work in unfamiliar contexts.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            To prepare effectively:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <alert>Study the theory</alert> (this book) for conceptual understanding.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            The problem sheets provide scaffolded access to exam-level questions by using 
            smaller numbers and fewer steps initially, then gradually increasing complexity. 
            By the end, you will recognize patterns and think: <q>This is what I do now.</q>

            This exposition is dense, direct, and to the point. To over-explain is to hide 
            the beauty of mathematics. The entire course is presented in comprehensive 
            theoretical chapters.
